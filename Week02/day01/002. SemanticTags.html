        Fall Guys (formerly Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout) is a platform battle
        royale game developed by Mediatonic. The game involves up to 60 players
        who control jellybean-like creatures and compete against each other in a
        series of randomly selected mini-games, such as obstacle courses or tag.
        Players are eliminated as the rounds progress until, eventually, the
        last remaining player is crowned the winner.

        <details>
          The game was released by Devolver Digital for Microsoft Windows and
          PlayStation 4 on 4 August 2020. Following their acquisition of
          Mediatonic, the publishing rights were transferred to Epic Games.
          Subsequently, the game was made free-to-play on 21 June 2022, and
          released on additional platforms including Nintendo Switch,
          PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, with full cross-platform
          play support among all platforms.[2][3] As part of the transition, the
          game adapted a seasonal battle pass system for its monetization,
          offering avatar customizations to players.

          <details>
            Fall Guys received positive reviews from critics for its chaotic
            gameplay and visual appearance. The game draws inspiration from game
            shows like Takeshi's Castle, It's a Knockout, Wipeout, and
            playground games like tag and British Bulldog.[4][5] The seventh and
            current season is Sports and Stadium-themed.
